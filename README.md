This is a [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) userscript that lets you provide your own subtitles to play over anime on
[VRV](https://vrv.co/) or [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/), to help with learning
Japanese.

# [Install](https://github.com/sheodox/jimaku-player/raw/master/dist/jimaku-player.user.js) (requires [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/))

If Tampermonkey is installed, clicking on the "Install" link above should present you with a Tampermonkey screen asking to confirm
installation, just click "Install" again on that page and you're done!

## Features

- Easily choose a subtitle file to use as you start watching an episode, then align them however
  you need so timing shouldn't be an issue.
- Click on a subtitle to open a [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org) search for that line (the video
  will automatically pause, and resume when you return).
- Choose your own subtitle text color to use if the subtitles don't specify one.
- Hover over the right side of the video to see a tray with some options, buttons to select a
  different subtitle file or re-align the current file, and the last ten subtitles so you
  can look back at a line you might have missed without having to rewind.

Currently supported subtitle formats:

- [.srt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip) - supported
- [.vtt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API) - basic support
  (positioning, and some forms of alignment)
- [.ass/.ssa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubStation_Alpha) - pretty good support (most general
  font styles like font family, size, colors, outlines, shadows, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough,
  etc), and many overrides are supported (position, outline/shadow colors and widths, fonts and
  sizing, bold, italic etc.)

If you would like support for other subtitle formats, please create an issue and I'll look into
it. I would love to support more subtitle formats and features!

## Usage

### Step 1 - Select a subtitle file

Click to open a file selection dialog for the episode's subtitles.

### Step 2 - Align subtitles

If you've aligned a show before, that'll be the first suggestion. Otherwise you're able to
automatically adjust the alignment by pressing a button when a line is said. [More info
on alignment.](#alignment)

### Step 3 - Watch!

### Settings and recent subs

Hover over the right side of the screen to open a tray that shows the last few subtitles. You can
click them to open a Jisho search if you missed something.

There are a several settings you can adjust, and I'm always adding more!

### Click subtitles to search for words you don't know!

## Alignment

Some subtitles might have a different start time than VRV does, like if VRV plays a studio's
intro before the episode but the subtitle timings assumes the episode starts immediately. In
instances like that the subtitles would show at the wrong times from when the lines are actually said by
possibly a considerable amount, and wouldn't be useful at all and is extremely distracting.
Because of this the first step after selecting a subtitle file for the episode is to align the
subtitles by figuring out by how much time the subtitles are offset from when they're actually
said.

Most of the time the subtitler can figure out the offset automatically with one button click. It
will show you the first several subtitles that show up in the script. You can click a subtitle the instant you
hear that line and the subtitler will calculate the timing discrepancy and the timing of all
subtitles will be adjusted accordingly.

If the subtitles get misaligned later in the video you can go back to the alignment wizard by
clicking _Realign Subtitles_ in the _Setup_ tab of the tray, then search for a word or subtitle
you hear. It will show the next few lines after each matching search result (it's already too
late to align to the subtitle you just heard, it'd be a second or two too late), and you can just
click one of those subtitles the moment you hear one of those.

### Fine Alignment Adjustment

If the alignment is a little off, you can use the fine alignment dialog, found in the Settings
tab of the tray, which will let you tweak the timing while watching the video until they're
perfect without having to retry automatic timing or guess at a different manual timing.

## Issues

If you have any issues, please let me know! This has worked well for me for several anime,
but are likely issues I don't know about with parsing, or lack of support for some extra
formatting that can be present in an subtitle file. Please don't hesitate to
[create an issue](https://github.com/sheodox/jimaku-player/issues/new)!

Please read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/sheodox/jimaku-player/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to help out!
