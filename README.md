This is a [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) userscript that lets you provide your own subtitles to play over anime on
 [VRV](https://vrv.co/) or [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/), to help with learning
  Japanese.

[Install (requires Tampermonkey)](https://github.com/sheodox/jimaku-player/raw/master/dist/jimaku-player.user.js)

## Features

* Easily choose a subtitle file to use as you start watching an episode, then align them however
 you need so timing shouldn't be an issue.
* Click on a subtitle to open a [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org) search for that line (the video
 will automatically pause, and resume when you return).
* Choose your own subtitle text color to use if the subtitles don't specify one.
* Hover over the right side of the video to see a tray with some options, buttons to select a
 different subtitle file or re-align the current file, and the last ten subtitles so you
 can look back at a line you might have missed without having to rewind.

Currently supported subtitle formats:
* [.srt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip) - supported
* [.vtt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API) - basic support
 (positioning, and some forms of alignment)
* [.ass/.ssa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubStation_Alpha) - pretty good support (most general
 font styles like font family, size, colors, outlines, shadows, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough,
 etc), and many overrides are supported (position, outline/shadow colors and widths, fonts and
  sizing, bold, italic etc.)

If you would like support for other subtitle formats, please create an issue and I'll look into
 it. I would love to support more subtitle formats and features!

## Usage

### Step 1 - Select a subtitle file

Click to open a file selection dialog for the episode's subtitles.

### Step 2 - Align subtitles

If you've aligned a show before, that'll be the first suggestion. Otherwise you're able to
 automatically adjust the alignment by pressing a button when a line is said. [More info
  on alignment.](#alignment)

### Step 3 - Watch!

### Settings and recent subs

Hover over the right side of the screen to open a tray that shows the last few subtitles. You can
 click them to open a Jisho search if you missed something.

There are a several settings you can adjust, and I'm always adding more!

### Click subtitles to search for words you don't know!

## Alignment

Some subtitles might have a different start time than VRV does, like if VRV plays a studio's
 intro before the episode but the subtitle timings assumes the episode starts immediately. In
 instances like that the subtitles would show at the wrong times from when the lines are actually said by
 possibly a considerable amount, and wouldn't be useful at all and is extremely distracting.
 Because of this the first step after selecting a subtitle file for the episode is to align the
 subtitles.
 
By clicking the automatic alignment at the right time the subtitler can figure out the timing
 discrepancy between the actual video time and the selected subtitle's start time. All subtitles
 will be adjusted by that timing difference. You can also manually enter the timing discrepancy
 used with the manual alignment.
 
The first few lines are often just "♪♪〜" or something similarly ambiguous to align with, so
 you can choose any one of the first 20 lines to try to time against. When using the automatic
 alignment you can click on the line that's shown to open a dropdown and select a different line.

If the alignment is a little off, you can use the fine alignment dialog, found in the Settings
 tab of the tray, which will let you tweak the timing while watching the video until they're
 perfect without having to retry automatic timing or guess at a different manual timing.

## Issues

If you have any issues, please let me know! This has worked well for me for several anime,
but are likely issues I don't know about with parsing, or lack of support for some extra
 formatting that can be present in an subtitle file. Please don't hesitate to 
 [create an issue](https://github.com/sheodox/jimaku-player/issues/new)!
