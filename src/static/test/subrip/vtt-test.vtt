WEBVTT

NOTE
This is a text script used to test formatting of subtitles produced with
字幕プレーヤー's SubRip/WebVTT renderer.

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is just a regular subtitle

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000 line:0
This has a "line:0" cue, should be
on the top (unless inverted)

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000 line:-1
This has a "line:-1" cue, should be on
the bottom (unless inverted)

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000 line:100%
This has a "line:100%" cue, should be on
 the bottom (unless inverted)

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000 line:50%
This has a "line:50%" cue, should be in the center

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is a regular subtitle, but
it has a lot of text. So much so
that it is split between three lines
